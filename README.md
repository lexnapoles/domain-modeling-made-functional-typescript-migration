# Domain Modeling Made Functional in Typescript

After finishing the transcendental book Implementing Domain-Driven Design, I wanted to learn about how to translate the concepts from object-oriented languages that heavily focus on classes (Java or C#) to more functional ones.

In my search, I discover Domain Modeling Made Functional by Scott Wlaschin. I fell in love with the book and F#. It showed how typed functional programming can be applied to model complex domains. It also led me to explore functional programming in more detail, and, after working through Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming, I have migrated the code from F# to TypeScript and the fantastic functional library `fp-ts`.
